	Durazno XInput Wrapper : https://github.com/KrossX/Durazno
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Durazno is a XInput to XInput wrapper that simply allows customization when
using XInput controllers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the GUI to create an INI with the desired settings, then drop the INI and 
the DLL in the game's directory where the main executable is.

If there's no INI in the current directory, the GUI or the DLL itself will
create one on first run. To change the INI with the GUI, just load the GUI 
from that same location. Or just edit it manually.

You might need to rename the DLL depending on the game. The following list
might help: http://code.google.com/p/x360ce/wiki/GameCompatibilityList

and his help with the GUI.
